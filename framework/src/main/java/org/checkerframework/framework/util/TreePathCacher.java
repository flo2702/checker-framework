/**
 * TreePathCacher is a TreeScanner that creates and caches a TreePath for a target Tree.
 *
 * <p>This class replicates some logic from {@code com.sun.source.util.TreePath.getPath} but caches
 * results so that lookups with overlapping paths reuse each other's work.
 *
 * <p>The search is <em>lazy</em> about allocation: {@link #scan} only pushes and pops the trees it
 * visits on {@link #currentStack} and allocates no {@link TreePath} during traversal. Only when the
 * target is reached does {@link #buildPathForStack} materialize (and cache) the {@link TreePath}
 * nodes along the root-to-target path. Off-path trees visited during a search are therefore not
 * cached, which keeps {@link #foundPaths} far smaller than caching every visited node would. See
 * the "TreePathCacher" entries in {@code docs/developer/performance-notes.md} for the allocation
 * measurements that motivated this design.
