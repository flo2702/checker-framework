 * An interface for viewpoint adaptation.

 * declaration viewpoint) and translates it to a type from another viewpoint (the receiver
 * viewpoint). For example, if a field's type uses an annotation like {@code @This}, viewpoint
 * adaptation replaces that annotation with the actual receiver type at the use site.
 *
 * <p>Viewpoint adaptation applies to member/field accesses, constructor invocations, method
 * invocations, and type parameter bound instantiations.
