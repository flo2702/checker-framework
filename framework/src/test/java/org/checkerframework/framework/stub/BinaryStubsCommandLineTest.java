/**
 * End-to-end tests for the reader side of binary {@code -Astubs} support: {@link
 * AnnotationFileElementTypes}'s {@code parseCommandLineStubLocation}, {@code
 * parseCommandLineStubResource}, {@code commandLineBinaryStub}, and the {@code
 * useBinaryForCommandLineStubs} gate. {@code
 * org.checkerframework.framework.stubifier.BinaryStubFileGeneratorTest} covers only the writer
 * (round-tripping per-file and bundle output); this class drives real compilations through {@link
 * TypecheckExecutor}, the same harness {@code CheckerFrameworkPerDirectoryTest} uses, so it
 * exercises the reader with dynamically generated fixtures that a checked-in jtreg test cannot have
 * (a checked-in {@code .astub.bin.gz} would defeat the point of a content digest).
 *
 * <p>Uses the {@code SubtypingChecker} with the test-only {@code Encrypted} qualifier ({@code
 * org.checkerframework.framework.testchecker.util.Encrypted}) rather than a real checker like
 * Nullness, so this test stays entirely within the {@code framework} module (Nullness lives in
 * {@code checker}, which depends on {@code framework}, not the other way around). A stub-annotated
 * {@code Lib.maybeEncrypted()} returns either {@code @Encrypted Object} (if its stub's annotation
 * took effect) or the default, unqualified {@code Object} (if it did not); passing the latter where
 * {@code @Encrypted} is required is an {@code argument.type.incompatible} error, so that error's
 * presence or absence is a direct, unambiguous signal of whether the stub was applied at all --
 * from either its text or its binary form.
