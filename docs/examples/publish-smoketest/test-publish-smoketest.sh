# Regression test for https://github.com/eisop/checker-framework/pull/1822:
# publish the checker-qual, checker-util, and checker artifacts the way a
# release would, then run a separate, standalone Gradle build that depends
# on the published `checker` artifact the way an external consumer would.
#
# This specifically guards against two failure modes that are invisible to
# the in-repo test suite, because that suite never resolves the published
# artifacts through Gradle Module Metadata the way an external project does:
#   1. The published org.gradle.jvm.version attribute not matching the
#      JDK the project actually targets (it previously reflected whatever
#      JDK ran Gradle on the publishing machine).
#   2. The `checker` artifact's published component lacking a compile-time
#      (java-api) variant, so `compileClasspath` resolution fails with
#      "No matching variant" even when the JVM version matches.
#   3. A published POM that omits a dependency the artifact needs at runtime.
#      The in-repo test suite cannot see this, because it never runs off the
#      published artifacts; the failure appears only when a consumer resolves
#      the POM, or when a bundled jar is missing classes it needs at load time.
#
# Publishing goes to an isolated, throwaway Maven-local repository (a fresh
# $HOME, so `~/.m2/repository` resolves underneath it) rather than the
# developer's real ~/.m2, so this is safe to run repeatedly and leaves no
# residue. The real $GRADLE_USER_HOME is kept so the existing Gradle
# dependency/build cache is still reused.
