/*
 * @test
 *
 * @summary Writing two AnnotatedFor annotations at one location -- rather than listing both
 * checkers in one, which value()'s array already supports -- is what needs AnnotatedFor to be
 * Repeatable: it lets two checkers have different applyToSubpackages settings on the same
 * package. javac exposes this as a single AnnotatedFor.List container instead of two bare
 * AnnotatedFor mirrors, so resolving it needs its own List-unpacking step, mirroring how
 * QualifierDefaults already handles DefaultQualifier and DefaultQualifier.List.
 *
 * Each compile line below runs one checker at a time against the same two-entry package-info:
 * running two top-level checkers together in one javac invocation is not used here, because doing
 * so has an unrelated, pre-existing behavior where a class already flagged by one checker's error
 * is not additionally checked by another -- confirmed with two ordinary, unrelated errors and no
 * AnnotatedFor involved at all. That is orthogonal to what this test checks.
