// applies to the array type itself rather than its element type), silently dropping it from the
// binary form of the annotated JDK. This let a null varargs array through checking incorrectly on
// the affected JDK methods (Class.getMethod's array-level nullness annotation was affected) and,
// conversely, could make an unrelated method's varargs array look nullable when it is not
// (String.format's array is not nullable, only its elements are). Caught by a downstream Daikon CI
// failure on branch binary-stubs-v2.
