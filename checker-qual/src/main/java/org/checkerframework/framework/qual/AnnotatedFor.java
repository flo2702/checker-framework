/**
 * Indicates that this class has been annotated for the given type system. For example,
 * {@code @AnnotatedFor({"nullness", "regex"})} indicates that the class has been annotated with
 * annotations such as {@code @Nullable} and {@code @Regex}. The argument to {@code AnnotatedFor} is
 * not an annotation name, but a checker name.
 *
 * <p>You should only use this annotation in a partially-annotated library. There is no point to
 * using it in a fully-annotated library nor in an application that does not export APIs for
 * clients.
 *
 * <p>This annotation has no effect unless the {@code
 * -AuseConservativeDefaultsForUncheckedCode=source} command-line argument is supplied. Ordinarily,
 * the {@code -AuseConservativeDefaultsForUncheckedCode=source} command-line argument causes
 * unannotated locations to be defaulted using conservative defaults, and it suppresses all
 * warnings. However, a class with a relevant {@code @AnnotatedFor} annotation is always defaulted
 * normally (typically using the CLIMB-to-top rule), and typechecking warnings are issued.
 *
 * <p>This annotation is stored in class files and is available via reflection at run time.
 *
 * <p>An {@code @AnnotatedFor} on a package also applies to subpackages, unless the {@code
 * applyToSubpackages} field is set to false. Setting it to false does not block an applicable
 * {@code @AnnotatedFor} on an enclosing package.
 *
 * <p>You may write multiple {@code @AnnotatedFor} annotations at the same location, for example to
 * give two type systems different {@code applyToSubpackages} settings on one package:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &nbsp; {@literal @}AnnotatedFor(value = "nullness", applyToSubpackages = false)
 * &nbsp; {@literal @}AnnotatedFor(value = "index", applyToSubpackages = true)
 * &nbsp; package mypackage;
 * </pre>
