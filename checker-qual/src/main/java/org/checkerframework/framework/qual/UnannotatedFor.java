/**
 * Indicates that this package, class, method, or constructor has not been annotated for the given
 * type system, even though an enclosing element is annotated for it. For example, if a package is
 * {@code @AnnotatedFor("nullness")} but one of its classes has not been annotated with
 * {@code @Nullable} and friends, mark that class {@code @UnannotatedFor("nullness")}. The argument
 * to {@code UnannotatedFor} is not an annotation name, but a checker name.
 *
 * <p>This annotation has no effect unless the {@code
 * -AuseConservativeDefaultsForUncheckedCode=source} or the {@code -AonlyAnnotatedFor} command-line
 * argument is supplied. It only subtracts from the scope of an enclosing {@link AnnotatedFor}: an
 * element in its scope is treated as if no enclosing {@code @AnnotatedFor} were present, so its
 * warnings are suppressed, and under {@code -AuseConservativeDefaultsForUncheckedCode=source} it is
 * also defaulted using conservative defaults. ({@code -AonlyAnnotatedFor} suppresses warnings
 * without changing defaults, the same as for {@link AnnotatedFor}.) An {@code @AnnotatedFor} on a
 * nested element takes effect again for that element. Writing both an {@code @AnnotatedFor} and an
 * {@code @UnannotatedFor} that name the same checker on one declaration is a warning ({@code
 * conflicting.annotatedfor}), because the two contradict each other; if that warning is suppressed,
 * the {@code @AnnotatedFor} wins, since {@code @UnannotatedFor} only subtracts from an
 * <em>enclosing</em> scope.
 *
 * <p>An {@code @UnannotatedFor} on a package also applies to subpackages, unless the {@code
 * applyToSubpackages} field is set to false. The innermost package annotation wins: an
 * {@code @UnannotatedFor} on a package excludes its subpackages from an {@code @AnnotatedFor} on an
 * enclosing package, and vice versa.
 *
 * <p>You may write multiple {@code @UnannotatedFor} annotations at the same location, for example
 * to give two type systems different {@code applyToSubpackages} settings on one package:
 *
 * <pre>
 * &nbsp; {@literal @}UnannotatedFor(value = "nullness", applyToSubpackages = false)
 * &nbsp; {@literal @}UnannotatedFor(value = "index", applyToSubpackages = true)
 * &nbsp; package mypackage;
 * </pre>
